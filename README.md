# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques
In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions from Dataset. We overcame the problem by creating a binary classifier using machine scikit learn and a few other Python libraries and experimenting with different machine learning techniques to see which fits better.
