# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions from Dataset. We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier using machine scikit learn, and few other Python libraries and experimenting with different machine learning techniques to see which fits better.
